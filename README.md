# Odyssey ðŸŽ¥

A simple telegram bot to download your favorite movies and series from cinepulse (private/unofficial) api.

## How ?

The bot fetches tmdb's api to get your content's tmdb id then get the source list from cinepulse's reverse engineered api.
If the source provides a mp4 file, the bot will give you the link to that mp4 file. Else, if the source provides a m3u8 playlist file, it will use ffmpeg to download the content from the m3u8 file.
